# Forkify-Project

[Check it out on Netlify](https://cosmic-sorbet-c6d346.netlify.app/). When I first finished the project, the UI rendered correctly, but since then there have been some UI bugs that I haven't fixed yet.

## Background
A website that uses a recipe API to generate search results and load recipe instructions. You can also add recipe ingredients to a shopping list and track your favorite recipes using local storage. The HTML and CSS were provided by a Udemy course, but all of the JS is mine. I used Babel and Webpack for this project.

## How to use the site
<b>Search for a recipe</b>
1. In the search bar, type a keyword, like pizza, and click Search. A sidebar containing a list of recipes related to the keyword will appear on the left side of the page.

<b>Load a recipe from the search results</b>
1. Search for a recipe.
2. Click on a recipe listed in the sidebar on the left side of the page.

<b>Add a recipe's ingredients to your shopping list</b>
1. Load a recipe from the search results.
2. Click Add to Shopping List. The page will add the currently loaded recipe's ingredients to your shopping list.

<b>Delete an ingredient from your shopping list</b>
1. Hover over an ingredient in the shopping list, and then click the orange x that appears. The page will remove the ingredient from the shopping list.

<b>View recipe cooking directions</b>
1. Load a recipe from the search results.
2. Click Directions. The original website containing the recipe will open in a new tab.

<b>Add a recipe to your list of favorites</b>

2. Click the heart below the recipe title.

<b>View your list of favorite recipes</b>
